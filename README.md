# API Assignment - Cucumber API Tests

This project contains API tests for a booking system using Cucumber and RestAssured. It leverages the Cucumber BDD framework to define behavior-driven tests and RestAssured for making HTTP requests and validating the responses.

## Project Structure

- `src/test/java/testRunner/`: Contains the **TestRunner** class to initialize the test suite and run all feature files.
- `src/test/java/steps/`: Contains step definition files that map the steps in feature files to actual code.
- `src/test/resources/features/`: Contains the feature files written in Gherkin syntax, which define the scenarios for the API tests.
